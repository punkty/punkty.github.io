            Very straight forward project for Day 3. If there was a pausing point in this episode I missed it. I was able to keep up with Wes today and code along. I did not run into any issues except for some minor spelling mistakes which were quickly dealt with. I learned a lot of fun new things in this episode so lets get to it!
        </p>
    <h4>The Task:</h4>
        <p>
            Today we made a couple of slider inputs which are of type "range". I was unaware of this input type. The main focus was to pair these inputs up with built in CSS variables. With a little help from javascript we create an interface that will manipulate our image that has the CSS variables attached to it.
        </p>
    <h4>Thoughts:</h4>
        <p>
            CSS is so cool! I have heard of variables in Sass and Less which compile back into CSS at the end of the day but I did not know about CSS variables. We used :root which as described per <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:root">MDN</a> says that the pseudo class :root is identical to the html selector excpet that its specificity is higher. MDN goes on to say that this is a good way to set global CSS variables. (which is what we used it for.) In the bottom example I set a variable frog to a hexidecimal value of green.
        </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
:root { 
    --frog: #34a853; 
}
                </code>
            </pre>
        <p>
            To use the defined variable the syntax is as follows:
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code>
div {
    background: var(--frog);
}
            </code>
        </pre>

        <p>
             I also learned from this project that document.querySelectorAll does not return an array. It returns a node list. The difference being that a node list does not have all the great methods of an array. The last big take away for me was this.dataset. Dataset comes in handy using data- attributes on an HTML element. You can add multiple attributes this way to store information on a particular tag. Then the magic behind dataset is that it will return each one of those attributes in a tidy object to pull out of in javascript. This was a great learning exercise and I am eager to apply some of these new tools to future coding solutions. I will definitely keep CSS variables, and dataset in my toolbelt for future projects. Below is the javascript used for this project.
